📌 Project Title: PacMen Factory

👀 [Demo](https://rawcdn.githack.com/ClaudiaLopezLagosGlez/PacMen-Factory/3812492ddc84fd737f1b70fbea588190820fb52f/index.html) 

🎯 Description of the project: This is an academic activity I did as part of the MIT Xpro Full Stack Developer program. Using one of the most famous video game characters, PacMan (created by video game designer Toru Iwatani of Namco and distributed by Midway Games to the US market in the early 1980s). The activity consists of creating multiple Pacmen through buttons. To supplement the design, I attached an image of the space with other characters of this video game and delimit the areas of the game. All this was done with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I hope you like it.

✨ How to run:
 Functions makePac() and checkCollisions were implemented.

🚀 Technologies:  HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  

✅ Requirements: Installing Git and copy the repository https://github.com/ClaudiaLopezLagosGlez/PacMen-Factory.git

♻️ Roadmap of future improvements: Add a PacMan sound. The mouth of each PacMan can move.
